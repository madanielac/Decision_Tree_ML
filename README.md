# Decision Tree - Machine Learning 

Top down decision tree induction algorithm is used for selecting a root stump from the training data based on the best option for information gain. A decision tree for the training data is constructed accordingly, and later on one for the testing data is built using established criteria.  
Error (mislabeling) is calculated for constructed trees.

Binary Trees are constructed for up to three layers.
